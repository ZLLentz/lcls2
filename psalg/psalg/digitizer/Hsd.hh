/*
 * This file was an early attempt to have C code that could use both
 * malloc (for psana) and a non-malloc "stack" (for the DAQ).  in the
 * end this code felt too complex, so it has been removed from the DAQ.
 */

/*
 * Summary of design ideas from cpo/yoon82 (9/11/19)
 *
 * The Channel class here are intended to be used both in the drp (C++) and
 * psana (via cython wrapper psana/psana/hsd/hsd.pyx).  The code
 * unpacks the firmware-compressed data into more usable in-memory
 * arrays (which can be exported to python, for example).
 * The guts of the code are Channel::_parse_waveforms and
 * Channel::_parse_peaks.  There is (at least) one complex idea:
 * The unpacked arrays are variable-length and we wanted to avoid calling
 * malloc on every event in the drp (OK to do that for psana) so
 * we should try to use the simple Stack obj in psalg/alloc/Allocator.hh
 * in the drp.  the python uses a similar Heap obj which calls malloc.
 * In the drp each core should have its own Stack to avoid reentrancy
 * problems.
 *
 * The "event header" is formed from the two uint32_t _opaque fields of the
 * TimingHeader and contains information about whether the event contains
 * raw, fex, or both.  Originally we had a class for this, but this
 * was switched to an array uint32_t[2] for two reasons:
 *
 * - easier inter-operability with python
 * - we only ever accessed the "streams" field
 * 
 * Structure of the event header:
 * 20b  unused
 * 4b   stream mask (raw is bit 0, fex is bit 1)
 * 8b   x"01"
 * 16b  trigger phase on the sample clock
 * 16b  trigger waveform on the sample clock
 *
 * Immediately following the EventHeader in the dma buffer are the stream
 * headers (raw and fex) and their associated data:
 * Note: if raw or fex data is missing, then the associated header is also
 * missing (e.g. if prescale is not set to 1).
 * Per-channel structure, if both raw/fex data are present:
 *
 * streamheader raw
 * raw data
 * streamheader fex
 * fex data
 *
